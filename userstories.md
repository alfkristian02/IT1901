# Conceptual model

## Concepts

### Design metaphor
- A Movie-object has a rectangular shape, just like a movie poster, with its attributes displayed on the front of this "poster" similar to a typical movie poster layout. 


### Data-objects 
- Movie-objects that can be initiated and deleted
- A "database" list-object which contains all Movie-objects that the user initiates
- A "watchlist" list-object which is a sublist of the "database" list-object, in which the user can add and remove Movie-objects

### Data-object attributes and operations

#### Movie-object attributes
- Title
- Release date
- Duration
- Rating (1, 2, ..., 10)
- Watchlist (boolean: in or not in the watchlist)

#### Movie-object operations
- Set and edit all attributes

#### List-object attributes
- A list consisting of Movie-objects, size initially zero

#### List-object operations
- Sort the Movie-objects contained in the list based on rating, title and duration
- Add Movie-objects
- Remove Movie-objects

### Relations
- The "database" list-object contains all the Movie-objects initiated by the user
- The "watchlist" list-object is a sublist of the "database" list-object
- The Movie-object has a title, release date, duration and rating

### Mapping
- The list-objects corresponds to a library of movies
- A Movie-object corresponds to an existing movie which the user is able to give his or hers own rating. Duration, title and cast is also determined by the user.

# Personas

Our personas are based on the user stories and the article "Norsk mediebarometer 2021" conducted by SSB, Statistics Norway [^1]. From the article, it appears that young men watch the most video and film media on average every day. That is why Magnus is one of our personas. If we manage to make an app that satisfies Magnus, our app should satisfy a large group of users in Norway, which is our goal. Figure 1 displays the proportion of the population that watches video media on an average day, by gender, age and education, in 2021. As one can see, there are also a lot of women that watch movies in the age group 25-44. That is why we included Live, so that the impacts of her and Magnus on the app can complement each other, and make a great product. We do not have personas for the age group 9-15 years old. The reason is that our target group and the users we have interviewed do not find themselves in this age group. Nevertheless, interviewing younger users should be considered when further developing the app in the future
